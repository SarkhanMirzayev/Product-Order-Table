Here you can press the 'Key-up' and 'Key-down' buttons then press 'Enter' or choose row with the double click on 'mouse'. Then you can insert the quantity of the selected order. If you want to add a new order before the value is entered, the page will return to you warning. If you want to delete the selected order, just press 'Shift + Delete'.
